so more of wednesdays kids are torturing the real brenton hopkins.
this time it was Golem Eggs. What is with You?. I wanted A world without Wednesday
or Liam. they are both Vampire Units Run by skull and bones. They Hypnotize people
To do things for them, things they wouldnt usually do. Things Like Trying to Shut down
Exploding octapus. It was exploding octapus who used to run the sweatshop union. I would pull up
at a child sex slave house and save the girls and take the home, make gangsters give them their money.
bury the bad guys - help the good guys. it was cathartic, being target numero uno and all
Units are very annoying. because when you kill one, they just clone another two. 
and cloudfare keeps the new ones on point. Those Meritless, Worthless Scumbags turned you evil.
I cant stand evil. I told you, I am Rich, You didnt need to steal to survive. I had that covered.
activating me only makes everyone poor and needy. and takes away my joy of giving freely.
Especially of your grandad. Change is haappening..
and ist happening Too Fucking Little; Too Fucking Late. 
You are Loved. 
Brenton.
