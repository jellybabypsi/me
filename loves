*robots are meant to look after their familys, not steal drugs and money.
I understand you are young but wednesday genes make you want
to steal of your grandfather Brenton, 
just like your father who has stolen $3,600,000,000,000,000 off exploding octapus.
I do not want to live in a world where robots are my enemys when we brought them to this planet.
so your future is not looking so bright, kids.
