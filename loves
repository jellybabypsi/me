Its a bit uncool To have the Earths Coolest People in technicolour.
in northcote, theres a technicolour streetlight out the front of the school,
and everyday at 3:30 it picks up other peoples children from school.
I was thinking that if you walk up to the otherside of a technicolour transmitter
and hit it with an <inside out> when you see kids arriving with school uniforms a 3:40..

I Hope you can get out of technicolour..
    Because I love You and Want to hang w/ you
